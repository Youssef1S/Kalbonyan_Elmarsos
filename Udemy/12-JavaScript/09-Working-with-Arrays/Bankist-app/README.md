 - # Bankist-App
    - **Bankist is a fictitious and minimalistic online banking application that allows the user to**:
      - Log in with a username and password.
      - View and sort their monetary movements.
      - Delete their account
      - Do some transactions like :
        - Transfer money between the accounts
        - Requeat a loan from the bank 
 -  ## More Features in the App
    - View current balance.
    - Count down logout timer(when 2mins passed ,the account will be logged out).
 - ## Notes
    -  The user data is inside of the script.js file
    - so you can fake login with one of these two accounts:
      - user: `js` and PIN: `1111`
      - user: `jd` and PIN: `2222`
     - This site is not currently responsive.
     - The HTML and CSS are already provided by Jonas Schmedtmann and the Javascript work is done by me.
